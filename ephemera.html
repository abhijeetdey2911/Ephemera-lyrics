        <p>My heart's a stereo

            It beats for you, so listen close
            
            Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
            
            Make me your radio
            
            And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
            
            This melody was meant for you
            
            Just sing along to my stereo
            
            
            
            Gym Class Heroes baby!
            
            If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
            
            Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
            
            If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
            
            Like yea [scratched], check it Travie, I can handle that
            
            Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
            
            It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
            
            I used to used to used to, now I'm over that
            
            'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
            
            
            If I could only find a note to make you understand
            
            I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
            
            Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
            
            And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
            
            
            
            My heart's a stereo
            
            It beats for you, so listen close
            
            Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
            
            Make me your radio
            
            And turn me up when you feel low
            
            This melody was meant for you
            
            Just sing along to my stereo
            </p>

            <p>The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Agg lavan majboori nu

Aan jaan di pasoori nu

Zehar bane haa teri

Pee javan main poori nu

Aana si oh nai aaya

Dil baang baang mera takraya

Kaga bol ke das jaavein

Pavan gheyo dee choori nu


Raawaan ch baawan ch

oh nu lukawaan

Koi mainu naa roke
Zara phank jhatak gai
Dhool atak aur lachak
Machak ke duur bhatak
Ud dagar dagar kasbe
Kuche nukkad basti

Mein yeah e yeah e
Itdi se mud ada ud
Kar le puri dil ki tamanna
Hawa se jud ada se ud
Purr bhuur bhurrr phuurrr
Tu hai hera panna ree

Masakali masakali
Ud mataak kali mataak kali
Masakali masa masa masa kali
Ahhheeyy oohhh X 2
